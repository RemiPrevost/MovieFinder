MovieFinder
===========

An easy way to find what film from your computer you will watch tonight.

I've always had difficulties to find what movie could I watch from my library of a thousand of movies, on my HDD. Witch one I've already seen, which one I haven't. So I've decided to create a program witch would sum up all the movies I have on my HDD. So I could ask, give me a list of movies that I haven't seen realised by Quentin Tarantino, for example.
